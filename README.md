The goal of LowCostRecipeCrator is to scrape recipe data, allow users to omit items they already have, then call out to find the lowest cost ingredient available to satisfy the ingredit listed. 

Thus allowing you, the user, to create the recipe with the lowest possible cost to you. 

Once fully functional, LowCostRecipeCrator will use the Kroger API to allow you to add the lowest cost ingedients to your cart, collect and then clip any available coupons. 


More details to come. Please note Kroger API functionality is currently non-functional.
